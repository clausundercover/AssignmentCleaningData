# AssignmentCleaningData

The project consists of a script called run_analysis.R
This script expects to find the data for the project http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones in a folder in the current working directory.
The current data is in the zip file here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
This zip file should be uncompressed to the current working directory where it will produce a folder called UCI HAR Dataset.
From this folder, it reads the following files:
  features.txt
  activity_labels.txt
  test/X_test.txt
  test/y_test.txt
  test/subject_test.txt
  train/X_train.txt
  train/y_train.txt
  train/subject_train.txt
The description of the files and the data within is contained in the README.txt file in the UCI HAR Dataset folder.
